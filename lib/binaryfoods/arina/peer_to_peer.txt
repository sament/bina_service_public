Gnutella is an early P2P communication mechanism. A Gnutella node needs to know the
location of at least one other Gnutella node in order to be able to work at all. Therefore
a Gnutella node is initialised with a set of working nodes. A Gnutella node is connected
to its working set and each connected node has its own working set of Gnutella nodes.
No Gnutella node needs to have the same working set as another Gnutella node. This
way of connecting creates a mesh of connected nodes, see figure 2.1.
The protocol uses flooding to find desired data among connected nodes. A node
A wants to get some data from the cloud so A makes a request for this data from all
its connected nodes and each of these nodes will make requests to all of their connected
nodes. In order to not letting the flooding actually flood the network forever each request
is given a Time To Live (TTL) which is an integer number that is decremented at each
node it reaches. A request is not further replicated from a node when the TTL for a
request reaches zero. When data is found inside the Gnutella network, the data is sent
directly to the requesting node.
