The journey of becoming better. It's a journey. The walk is the path

XP(ExperiencePoints): Rewards users 0.03 for behaving well in the system.
What are the behaviours?
Let's start with our northstar(the consumer behvour that is key to  our revenue)
A hotel's northstar is frequency of visits.
According to marketing and finance experts, three things increases revenue.
    1 => Price 
    2 => Number of Customers
    3 => Frequency

If a plate of food goes for N500 and we have 500 customers buying at 1 plate a day.
Our revenue becomes N250,000 a day. 
To generate more revenue =>
    1 => We can increase price (but it can cause some customers to leave except you do something about it)
    2 => We can do more marketing to increase our number of customers (if we are well funded we can engineer the growth capacity early)
    3 => Persuade the customers to order more frequently

For each path there are mways 

Every step above requires effective communications and marketing.
We need to understand our users(pain points)

****REVENUE** SELL access to experts/partners INFORMATION (from dietician? perarps a 2 man unit that breakd down books to consumable slides)

Attract more people by reducing the price? That works. But it puts us in a position of comodity.
Consumers don't get loyal to comodities. They can easily find alternatives. We don't want to go into price wars with well funded food startups like Jumia Foods, OFoods and the likes. So what do we do?

What do workers fear?

Not being able to meet expectations on cost, income and death. Safety is a general consciousness for workers and professional firms.
We can't allow small player into the system. Background checks and vetting needs to be done. This will be accomplished with a combination of APIs and
