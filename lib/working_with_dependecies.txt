Working with dependencies
Depending on third-party libraries is an important feature. As soon as you start
developing more complicated projects, you’ll probably want to use various librar-
ies, such as web frameworks, the JSON parser, and database drivers, to name a few
examples. Such libraries can simplify various side concerns, prevent you from going
down too many rabbit holes, and allow you to focus on the core challenges of your
system.
For example, in the current implementation of the to-do system, you maintain a
small pool of database workers, which allows you to have controlled parallelism of data-
base operations. You implemented this pool completely from scratch back in chapter
7. But as it happens, managing a pool of processes is a frequent pattern in Elixir and
Erlang, so a couple of third-party libraries offer a solution to this challenge. In this
chapter, you’ll replace your naive implementation of the process pool with a proven
and battle-tested process pool library.
