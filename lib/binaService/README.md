Sell Data Storage Space for people.
We store the data in ETS cache via a GenServer process.
Then we use plug to have an interceptor before going to Cache.

The interceptor will contain the logic needed for routing the user's request....

Just use Phoenix's controllers and put an abstraction logic before the Repo



Just as AWS sells tools. We will sell and comoditize business functions for businesses.
This will be handled by the Enterprise Business Unit

Sell Checkin/Checkout so users can keep virtual counts of entry and exit. It's like we're giving them preformated data store 
Sell inventory (Provide functions)


Sell data/storage/encryption...tight like blockchain's. You can't crack without privatekey

Sell API  ...provide ERP APIs
